ITEC 5102: Project Meeting [2020-09-24]

Attendees:
Fahmida H.
Georges A.
Jeff B.

Purpose: To discuss the project topic and determine direction for proposal due October 4th. To understand the
	 goal of the project, the tools necassary to reach these goals, and determine a jumping off point to
	 begin work on the project.

-REmote security for services (protected service)
- IEP
- Figure out a service based vpn
- Nebula - link services through sevice network
- consul.io by hashcorp
- tailscale full mesh vpn using wiregaurd
- Nebula: lighthouse (discovery system) connects peers directly
- Tinc vpn

- not too many papers available on this topic

What do we want to do? - demonstrate the need for service networking (consul and google IEP) proxy-ing the service
Why do we want to do it?
How are we going to do it?
2 month deliverable timeline

- use python and docker with mqtt host, packet capture on the link (encrypted without changing mqtt)
- whats the difference between this and a vpn? This vpns a specific service not an entire subnet
- use s-tunnel and docker to have automated final product
- socs proxy?? 
- streisand server - playbook to set up vpns - shadow socs - secure socs5 proxy

shadowsocs or s-tunnel:
- shadowsocs is more of an s-tunnel

presentation sign up:
Progress november 9th
Results december 7th

Final outcome: have a way to encrypt traffic at a service level without changing the service itself

buzzwords: service encrytpion proxy

if i can understand consul, thatd be good. consul is the gold standard.
	- a streamlined version of their service would be a good goal for the project
	- 3 or 4 streams of traffic, one is the protected traffic, the rest we don't care about, demonstrate
	  that traffic is encrypted and round trip delay of other streams are not affected
	- show that wiregaurd cannot read the data
	- email proxy? could be good

future: www.whatsapp.com - for group messaging
	jitsi for group meetings - meet.jit.si/ITEC5102

python: mqtt library
	elastic search library
	request library to post data - post secret to webserver through s-tunne

	proposal - due october 5th
	intro presentation - due september 30th

	All: 	- read proposal and make changes accordingly

	George:	- set up lab
		- vpn access
		- start on python script
		- dockerizing STunnel
